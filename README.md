# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles, public for convenience and reference. If you like what you see, I'd
recommend forking rather than cloning.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a symlink in your home directory to the `.zshrc` file in the repo.
3. Restart your shell, or log out then in again.
